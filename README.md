🍷 Wine Clustering

An AI-powered Unsupervised Learning project that applies clustering techniques to group wines based on their chemical properties. Instead of predicting predefined labels, this project uses clustering to discover hidden patterns and natural groupings in the data, providing insights into wine quality, composition, and similarities.

🚀 Features

📊 Unsupervised Clustering – Groups wines without predefined labels

🔬 Data Preprocessing – Scales and normalizes features for accurate clustering

🧠 Clustering Algorithms – Implements K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN

📉 Dimensionality Reduction – Uses PCA for 2D/3D visualization of clusters

📈 Evaluation Metrics – Silhouette score and visual validation of clusters

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core programming language

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling and preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms (K-Means, PCA, metrics)

Scipy – Hierarchical clustering

⚙️ How It Works

Data Preprocessing – Load dataset, clean missing values, and scale features.

EDA – Explore feature distributions and correlations.

Dimensionality Reduction – Apply PCA to project data into lower dimensions.

Clustering – Implement algorithms:

K-Means

Hierarchical Clustering

DBSCAN

Evaluation – Use Silhouette Score and visualizations to assess clustering quality.

🎯 Applications

Wine Classification – Distinguishing types of wine based on chemical composition

Quality Control – Ensuring wine consistency across production

Market Segmentation – Grouping wines for consumer preference analysis

Recommendation Systems – Suggesting wines based on cluster similarity

📌 Future Enhancements

Use Deep Learning-based clustering (Autoencoders + K-Means)

Deploy clustering results in an interactive web app

Extend to other beverage datasets for generalization
