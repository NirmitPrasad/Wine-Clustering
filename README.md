# Wine-Clustering
This project is an AI-based Wine Clustering System that applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to group wines into clusters based on their chemical properties. Instead of predicting a predefined label, clustering helps in exploring hidden patterns, providing insights into wine quality, characteristics, and similarities.
